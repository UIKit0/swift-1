    TRIAL TODO

STATE MACHINE
* imposed HINTs are terribly broken, resend the same data over and over again
* check ACK/HAVE redundancy
* small-progress update problem (aka peer nap)
  guarantee size of updates < x% of data, on both ends
* HAVE ALL / HAVE NONE
* aggregate ACKS (schedule for +x ms)

PERFORMANCE
* move to the.zett's binmaps
* optimize redundant HASH messages
* move to rotated ACK queue
* 32 bit time field
* ?empty/full binmaps

CACHING/FILES
* connection rotation
* file rotation
* real LRU/LFU
* file/hash-file re-open in read-only mode
* no cache recheck, failure-resistant
* completion mark
* unified events/callbacks
* move to 64-bit IO
* Transfer(fd) constructor
* think of sliding window(s)

MANIFOLD
* all-swarm performance stats
* run chained setups (cmd line protocol subsetting)
* implement: multiple swift instances per server
* run thousand-daemon caching tests (use httpgw)
* use a dedicated tracker
* add NATs to the setup
* recover mfold.libswift.org
* integrate Windowses

OTHER
* Sha1Hash constructor ambiguity
* don't #include .cpp
* think of using HTTP (?) as a fallback
