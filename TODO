    TRIAL TODO

STATE MACHINE
* imposed HINTs are terribly broken, resend the same data over and over again
* check ACK/HAVE redundancy
* small-progress update problem (aka peer nap)
  guarantee size of updates < x% of data, on both ends

PERFORMANCE
* move to the.zett's binmaps
* optimize redundant HASH messages
* move to rotated ACK queue

CACHING/FILES
* connection rotation
* file rotation
* real LRU/LFU
* file/hash-file re-open in read-only mode
* no cache recheck, failure-resistant
* unified events/callbacks
* move to 64-bit IO

MANIFOLD
* all-swarm performance stats
* run chained setups (cmd line protocol subsetting)
* implement: multiple swift instances per server
* run thousand-daemon caching tests (use httpgw)
* use a dedicated tracker
* add NATs to the setup
* recover mfold.libswift.org
* integrate Windowses
